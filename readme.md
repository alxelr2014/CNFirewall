Even a moderately long port sequence guarantees security against an attacker who uses a brute force method.
However, a more sophisticated attacker is able to use other types of attacks such as `relay` or `man in the middle` to compromise the system. 
For this reason, port knocking schemes are often implemented with other forms of authentication.
